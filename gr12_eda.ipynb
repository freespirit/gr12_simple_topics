    "\n",
    "ZigZag wants to be a revolutionary project in the ZK Rollup space and aims at the end-game scaling solutions for Ethereum. We want to be the first, we want to be the best. We want to push out great products with high quality as fast as possible. We do not limit ourselves. Our vision is not to launch a mediocre DEX. Instead, we are aiming to bring the usability of centralised exchanges to a DEX that previously was not possible. With ZK Rollups, it is. Having sufficient liquidity and orderbook depth is a key factor that holds back a lot of DEXs from succeeding, which is what our main aim is to get right.\n",
    "\n",
    "Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "ZigZag is a decentralised orderbook exchange that utilizes ZK-Rollup tech by allowing traders to perform spot trades with minimal slippage and thick orderbooks. The problem that every AMM-based DEX has on other Layer 2 Rollups is having miniscule liquidity. For simple swaps the impact on price movement is not significant. However, if one is attempting to trade with size relative to over $500k, to get the best quotes it is necessary to bridge back to mainnet Ethereum and pay its fees for aggregated liquidity that is available there. ZK Rollups can solve this by offering negligible fees on transactions, allowing for any market inefficiency to be taken advantage of in an instant by market makers, which was previously not possible on a DEX. We are aiming to acquire sufficient liquidity to the extent that users will not have to pay Ethereum gas fees on mainnet in order to get quoted for a similar price.\n",
    "\n",
    "We launched as the first and still the only DEX on zkSync 1.x. We will also launch as the first DEX on StarkNet, which you can currently try out on our testnet (limited functionality). Due to our first mover advantage we are capturing a lot of attention. Our volume has been breaking records every week. Last week we had a total volume of $52M with a record breaking day of $13.2M in volume on the last day of the week.\n",
    "\n",
    "Team background\n",
    "\n",
    "Our team derives from crypto natives who are all experienced traders. Having personal experience in using decentralized exchanges allows us to recognize what is required for a DEX to succeed. The founder of ZigZag is a leading developer in Solidity, but we dare to say he is one of the, if not the best, Cairo dev out there. Our founder coded most of our DEX on zkSync and is the reason we exist and captured the first mover advantage we have. Another experienced dev joined our team recently and focuses on StarkNet and coding a non-custodial liquidity pool for market makers. With these guys we have a confirmed advantage and head start over any other competition building on StarkNet. Our team is joined by a small group of experienced devs who are very committed to helping us expand ZigZag even more. We are also in contact with most of the big and small players that are building next to us and are looking forward to collaborating with anyone for the good of Ethereum’s scalability.\n",
    "\n",
    "With our combined skills, trading knowledge and maybe most importantly full-time commitment, we have the ability to create a leading DEX on zkSync and StarkNet from the development side, as well as ensuring that the incentives for traders are sufficient for them to not require an alternative.\n",
    "\n",
    "Achievements and future plans\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, we have our exchange live on zkSync 1.0. We’re using the native zkSync atomic swap feature to match orders. The gas fee is paid to the relayer and included in the atomic swap. We also made a bridge UI that taps into zkSync’s smart contract to bridge between Ethereum and zkSync. We have a StarkNet testnet up, but right now with limited functionality. However, this will soon change as Starkware is moving quickly. Be sure to check out our announcements. Furthermore, our governance proposal for Frax passed (https://gov.frax.finance/t/fip-36-frax-x-zigzag-partnership/272): Frax will provide us for a total of $20M in liquidity. The first millions have arrived. This liquidity will be used to keep our DEX liquid on zkSync for now and once StarkNet fully launches we will move the majority of our liquidity there since it will have more functionality. We also have a MIM proposal up (https://forum.abracadabra.money/t/proposal-bring-mim-onto-starknet-through-zigzag-exchange/1065) to kickstart our DEX on StarkNet, since StarkNet will have more functionality than zkSync 1.0 currently has.\n",
    "\n",
    "Limit orders and margin trading will be possible on StarkNet and zkSync 2.0. On StarkNet we are also building a non-custodial liquidity pool that market makers can tap into to use and market make on our DEX. We can turn this into a dAMM. As said before, we made a bridge UI for zkSync, but we are working on a fast withdrawal mechanism. We’re also working on a bridge UI for StarkNet and will provide fast withdrawals there too. Another future plan is adding more bridges to our website. One that has the most priority would be zkSync <-> StarkNet. We are thinking further into the future about implementing NFT related features on zkSync: viewing and sending NFTs on our website. We would later turn this into the first NFT Marketplace.\n",
    "\n",
    "We’re eagerly awaiting zkSync 2.0, which will be zkEVM. This will give us way more possibilities on our DEX. We might even build on other Layer 2 ZK Rollups if we have the developer capacity for it. Once Loopring, ZKSwap and Polygon Hermez are zkEVM, we could start building there.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reasoning for grant\n",
    "\n",
    "As the first DEX on zkSync we've been very active in the zkSync ecosystem, but also with the community and catering to them. One of the few live use cases on zkSync right now, besides our DEX, is donating to Gitcoin grants. This can be done in a cheap way by either by bridging funds from Ethereum Layer 1 -> zkSync Layer 2 (https://trade.zigzag.exchange/bridge) or by using a fiat ramp like Ramp Network (https://ramp.network/) to zkSync. These Gitcoin grants created demand for DAI, so a while back we added DAI pairs to our exchange (ETH/DAI, WBTC/DAI, DAI/USDC, DAI/USDT). A lot of people started using ZigZag to grab DAI for Gitcoin grants and started requesting us to create our own grant. They wanted to donate to us! We decided to open a Twitter poll (https://twitter.com/ZigZagExchange/status/1469983150180909057) and after 1 day more than 1300 people voted \"Yes\", telling us that they would want to donate to us. This gave us great confidence in creating our own grant.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use of funds\n",
    "\n",
    "As seen in our tweet, we are self funding right now. This Gitcoin grant will give us the ability to spend more funding on development. We would love to scale up our development team and with the support of our community it seems like we will be able to do this. Development can mean anything ranging from frontend and backend development to GFX/UI/UX design.\n",
    "\n",
    "Developer? Contact us!\n",
    "\n",
    "We would love to hear your feedback on our product, so please use our exchange, read our code in Github and join our community. If you are interested in our project and think that you could help us out or even contribute to building on ZK Rollups, don't hesitate and contact us here: https://info.zigzag.exchange/#contact. With our grant donations we will be able to take onboard more developers and maybe that person will be you! Who knows we’ll even see you on our team in the future!\"\"\""

    "The Nym network is a decentralized mixnet to support anonymity and unlinkability at the network layer (layer 0) across any blockchain and application. Unlike Tor and Katzenpost/Meson, Nym uses blockchains in order not to have a central directory and uses incentives to decentralize the mix network itself. Due to cover traffic and timing delays based on the Loopix design, Nym provides superior privacy than both VPNs and Tor, and can be integrated to communicate with any blockchain to enable communication without censorship or fear. Nym fills in the missing pieces of the cryptographic revolution necessary to end mass surveillance.\n",

    "Claudia Diaz, CSO (Chief Science Officer) with 20 years working on privacy-enhancing technologies, she is one of Europe’s preeminent researchers in the field recognized for her contribution to the foundations of metadata protection from surveillance, traffic analysis, tracking, localization and behavioral profiling.\n",
    "Dave Hrycyszyn, CTO has founded, built and sold several companies from Chainspace, Blockmainia, and the Vega protocol. He is a co-author of the blockchain-sharding protocol Chainspace and the leaderless, PBFT-variant consensus protocol Blockmania, the prototype of which turned out to be likely the world’s fastest distributed ledger (400,000 TPS with 2 secs finality).\n",
    "Jedrzej Stuczynski, Lead Developer has a Master of Engineering in Computer Science with First Class Honours from University College London. During his thesis work he studied the Coconut signature scheme under the supervision of George Danezis and then implemented it.\n",
    "Ania Piotrowska, Head of Research has masters degree with specialization in Analysis of Algorithms from the Faculty of Fundamental Problems of Technology at Wroclaw University of Technology and is a designer of the Loopix mixnet, with her PhD advisor and original Nym and Chainspace co-founder George Danezis.\n",

    "Status\n",
    "We just launched our Rust code for the Nym mixnet at the end of December 2019. For the rest of Q1 2020, we are fine tuning our validator development in order to prepare for beta release that will enable use of Nym with Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n",
